#Challenge #2

This code is looking to create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following :

The ticker symbol

Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

As well as, return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
